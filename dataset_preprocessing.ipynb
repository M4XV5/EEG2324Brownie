    "### \"Task-level Value Affects Trial-level Reward Processing\" - the original paper in brief\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Experiment: \n",
    "- Participants were presented with **slot machines** (\"trials\") where they had to select one of two arms to pull. If the participant selected the correct arm on the slot machine, they would **\"win\"** at the machine and gain \\\\$0.03, while if they selected the wrong arm, they would **\"lose\"** the trial i.e. gain \\\\$0.00.\n",
    "- The **win/loss feedback** for each slot machine was shown to them after they selected an arm. Their goal was to **win as much money as possible**.\n",
    "- Each slot machine was preceded by a **cue** (coloured shape) shown to the participant. The slot machines were divided into three sets or **casinos** (\"tasks\").\n",
    "- The different cues corresponded to **different types of slot machines**. Some machines, called **\"low-value\" machines**, had a 50% win probablility on both arms, while others called **\"high-value machines\"** had an 80% win probability on one arm and 20% on the other.\n",
    "- For high-value machines, if the participant selected the 80%-arm it was considered a **\"correct\"** response. There was no \"correct\" response for a low-value machine.\n",
    "- The **participants were not informed** of these differences. The **win amount was kept constant** across all slot machines.\n",
    "- The **three casinos had a mix of high- and low- value machines** - one each of \"high-value\" and \"low-value\" task/casino containing only high-/low- value slot machines respectively, and a \"mid-value\" task containing equal numbers of both.\n",
    "- Each of the 6 machine types was presented 24 times in random order (144 trials per task).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Research question: \n",
    "How does task-level reward processing affect trial-level value processing in ACC?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Preprocessing:\n",
    "- Excluding participants who did not learn the cues - in order to be included, a participant should have **correct** responses for **at least 60% of the trials** in the mid and high value tasks.\n",
    "- For each task, the first ten trials for each cue type were excluded, since it was assumed that the participants would still be learning the cues.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analysis:\n",
    "- The researchers looked into \"Reward Positivity\" (RewP), which corresponds to how much outcomes differ from learned action values \\[1].\n",
    "- They created the feedback-locked ERP (mean across epochs) for different task-cue-participant combinations. Then, they constructed difference waves between the mean win ERP and mean loss ERP across all participants for the task-cue combination.\n",
    "- They examined the data from the FCz electrode between 240â€“340 ms post feedback, based on the recommendations from previous research on reward prediction. The RewP was defined as the maximum voltage within this window for each task-cue-participant.\n",
    "- Analysis was carried out in MATLAB 2022a using the EEGLab library.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some notes on the dataset\n",
    "- Although the paper says the data was sampled at 250 Hz, according to the dataset the sampling rate is 1000 Hz and we have proceeded assuming this 1kHz value.\n",
    "- The paper states that the 10-20 electrode montage was used.\n",
    "- Due to participants' wishes, only part of the data was shared by the researchers - that collected at the Oxford testing site. This means that we have fewer subjects to analyse, and also that the notch filtering required will be only at one frequency (50 Hz at Oxford).\n",
    "- Each subject's 'eeg' subfolder contains a 'sub-XX_task-casinos_events.json' containing names and descriptions of the events like onset of fixation cross, cue onset, response, and feedback. This list is not complete, namely some events like S12, S22, S32 for the cue onsets are missing. However, the events are present in the data and can be used directly for data processing.\n",
    "- Event name format: Each event name consists of four characters, with spaces used for padding (e.g. ```S  6, S 16```). However in some forms of output (e.g. in jupyter notebooks that we used while initially exploring the data) it can show up as three characters (```S 6, S 16```) and in the json file mentioned above the names are also slightly different (```S6, S16```).

    "### Removing Participants and Trials from the Analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before passing the data to the automated pipeline, we exclude some trials and participants according to the rules below: \n",
    "1. We are removing the first **n** trials for every cue in every casino. This ensures that the participants are able to learn the pattern of every slot as we want to measure how the RewP changes in different average task values. For that the participants have to learn first how the cues of every slot machine correspond to the reward. Here, we decided to reduce the number of trials excluded per machine type (cue) to 4 trials, since we have less data to work with overall.\n",
    "2. We are removing participants that do not manage to get **threshold** of the learnable trials correct, i.e. choosing the lever with the higher win probability. Thus, we assume that participants did not truly care about the reward or did not manage to learn the cues. "

These can be specified in the 'conditions' parameter of the configuration file. Later on, the pipeline can be run for a different set of events by changing the 'conditions' parameter, e.g. we can analyse cue-locked waveforms rather than feedback-locked as we have done here.\n",

In a previous version of the pipeline we were using (1.5), epoching was done before ICA, whereas in the latest version v1.7, the epoching step can be run after the ICA steps. For our pipeline, we have a variable ```ica_train_step``` which should be set to True when performing the ICA and False after the ICA training is done.
